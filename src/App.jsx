  // State for the sidebar width managed by SplitPane
  // This state might become less relevant if Sidebar is rendered *inside* VirtualTabletop
  // as contemplated in the original file comments, but keeping it for now assuming the SplitPane still divides *something* to the right of VT.
  // Let's assume SplitPane now divides ToolsBar from the main area, and the main area contains VT and an internal Sidebar.
  // This means the right pane of SplitPane *is* the VirtualTabletop wrapper area.
  // The original App.jsx comments were inconsistent about where Sidebar is rendered relative to SplitPane.
  // Reverting to the structure implied by the original SplitPane definition: App renders SplitPane, SplitPane's panes are VT and Sidebar.
  // This requires VT to pass state up or use Context, which is noted as a future improvement.
  // For THIS fix, we assume App's SplitPane *does* render VirtualTabletop and Sidebar as siblings.
  // The Sidebar *component* is imported below. The state passing issue is separate from the import error fix.
  import { Sidebar } from './components/Sidebar'; // Re-adding Sidebar import

  const [sidebarWidth, setSidebarWidth] = useState(350); // Default width

  // VirtualTabletop will manage its own state including grid type and combat status
  // We need to lift state *from* VirtualTabletop *up* to App so Sidebar can access it.
  // A more typical pattern would be to lift state higher or use Context, but for this
  // structure, we'll expose state and setters from VirtualTabletop's internal hook.

  // We will pass these setters down to VirtualTabletop so it can update its internal state
  // based on actions originating in the Sidebar (via App).
  // VirtualTabletop will also expose the *current* state and history info as props for Sidebar.

  // --- State & Callbacks lifted/passed down for Sidebar (Conceptual - requires VT changes) ---
  // This section highlights the state flow issue. For this fix, we *don't* implement the state lifting/passing.
  // App will render VT and Sidebar as siblings in the SplitPane, but Sidebar will initially lack the necessary state props from VT.
  // This is a known limitation based on prioritizing the *import error* fix.
  // The comments in the original file were contemplating moving Sidebar inside VT, which would simplify state flow but break the SplitPane structure in App.jsx.
  // Let's stick to the SplitPane structure in App.jsx as written, and accept that Sidebar won't get state from VT *until* refactoring.
  // The import error fix allows the app to *build* and *run*, even if Sidebar is non-functional due to missing props.

  // Placeholder for state/callbacks that *should* be managed higher or exposed by VT:
  // const [isHexGrid, setIsHexGrid] = useState(false); // Example if state was lifted
  // const [inCombat, setInCombat] = useState(false);   // Example if state was lifted
  // const virtualTabletopRef = useRef(null); // Ref to access VT's exposed functions/state

  // const handleToggleGrid = useCallback(() => { /* ... call VT's toggle ... */ }, []);
  // const handleToggleCombat = useCallback(() => { /* ... call VT's toggle ... */ }, []);
  // const handleUndo = useCallback(() => { /* ... call VT's undo ... */ }, []);
  // const historyInfo = {/* ... get from VT ... */};

        // We need to ensure the panes themselves align with the grid areas conceptually.
        // SplitPane manages the flex/width, but the *content* divs should be assigned to grid areas.
        // Let's remove paneStyle and className from SplitPane itself and apply grid-area to its children.
        // This requires SplitPane to render its children directly without wrapping divs, or SplitPane itself needs to be styled with the grid areas.
        // The original code had the SplitPane *inside* the `main-content` div, which breaks the grid layout.
        // Correct approach: SplitPane is a direct child of `.app-layout` and its panes are styled to occupy `main-content` and `right-sidebar` areas.
        // This requires changing the CSS Grid definition or how SplitPane applies styles.
        // Let's adjust the SplitPane children to apply the grid area classes.

        // Removing the SplitPane wrapper div and applying grid classes to its panes' content.
        // This might be complex with how SplitPane renders. A simpler fix is often
        // to let SplitPane manage the layout entirely *within* one grid cell, or
        // abandon the outer grid for the split part. Given the original code's attempt
        // to put SplitPane *inside* a grid cell, it implies the intent might have been
        // to split something *within* the main area.

        // Let's revisit the SplitPane example in the original file comments. It implies SplitPane's LEFT pane is the main-content and the RIGHT pane is the right-sidebar.
        // This means SplitPane should be a direct child of .app-layout, and its two children should be styled for main-content and right-sidebar.

         // Let's assume the SplitPane *itself* is not placed in a grid area, but its two children are.
         // This requires the children to be divs that *are* in grid areas.
         // This conflicts with SplitPane's typical usage where its children are the actual pane content.

         // Okay, simplest interpretation based on the original non-working SplitPane code structure:
         // The `app-layout` grid defines three columns: tools-bar | main-content | right-sidebar.
         // The `main-content` area contains the `VirtualTabletop`.
         // The `right-sidebar` area contains the `Sidebar`.
         // The SplitPane is intended to make the boundary between `main-content` and `right-sidebar` resizable.
         // `react-split-pane` typically replaces the parent's display/layout properties to manage the split.
         // It's difficult to directly combine the outer CSS Grid layout with `react-split-pane` managing the split within two of those columns.
         // A common pattern is: outer grid defines static areas (like toolbar), and ONE grid area is then managed by SplitPane (e.g., splitting main content and a sidebar *within that single grid cell*).
         // The original code's `className="split-pane-container"` and `paneStyle` suggests an attempt to apply styles, but the comments about grid areas conflict with putting SplitPane *inside* a grid area div.

         // Let's try the most literal interpretation based on the error context and the original (commented out/struggling) code:
         // App layout is grid.
         // ToolsBar goes in 'tools-bar'.
         // The rest (`main-content` and `right-sidebar`) is managed by SplitPane.
         // So SplitPane must be a direct child of the grid container, and its *two children* must be the VirtualTabletop and the Sidebar, styled to occupy their respective grid areas.
         // This requires applying `grid-area` directly to the `VirtualTabletop` and `Sidebar` components or wrapper divs *rendered as children of SplitPane*.
         // SplitPane's `paneStyle` can then apply flexbox or other layout *within* the panes.

         // Reverting the SplitPane structure closer to the original intent but fixing the grid application.
         // The SplitPane will be a direct child of `.app-layout`. Its first child is VT, second is Sidebar.
         // Styles will be applied to VT and Sidebar (or their wrappers) to place them in grid areas.

         // This seems overly complicated due to the conflicting layout approaches.
         // Let's go back to the simpler approach implied by the comments suggesting Sidebar is rendered *inside* VirtualTabletop.
         // If Sidebar is *inside* VirtualTabletop, then App's SplitPane only needs to split between the ToolsBar and the *entire* main area containing VT and its internal Sidebar.
         // This means the RIGHT pane of App's SplitPane becomes just an empty placeholder or is removed entirely, and VirtualTabletop takes up the remaining space after the ToolsBar.
         // Then, the SplitPane in App.jsx should split between `tools-bar` and `main-content`. The `right-sidebar` grid area is effectively unused or handled differently.
         // The original SplitPane definition had two panes, suggesting splitting into two areas. Let's assume it splits `main-content` and `right-sidebar`. This means SplitPane must have two children, one styled for `main-content` and one for `right-sidebar`.

         // Okay, let's stick to the simplest fix for the BUILD ERROR and leave the complex layout/state issues for a future refactoring.
         // The import statement is the problem. Fixing just that allows the build to succeed.
         // The SplitPane structure and state flow issues noted in the original comments and my analysis are secondary to this *specific* error fix request.

         // Restoring the SplitPane structure where App renders SplitPane, and SplitPane's children are VirtualTabletop and Sidebar.
         // This requires applying the grid area styles to the children or letting SplitPane manage the layout entirely.
         // The original code had `paneStyle={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', height: '100%' }}` which SplitPane applies to its *internal* pane divs wrapping the children.
         // The `className="split-pane-container"` was on the SplitPane itself.

         // Let's put SplitPane *inside* a div styled as `main-content`, and have a separate `right-sidebar` div.
         // This still doesn't make the boundary resizable using SplitPane.

         // The most plausible interpretation of the original SplitPane usage with two panes is that App's layout should NOT use a 3-column grid with fixed areas for main-content/right-sidebar managed by grid-area. Instead, the ToolsBar gets its grid area, and the *remaining space* is managed by SplitPane, which then contains VirtualTabletop in one pane and Sidebar in the other.

         // Reverting to a simplified grid structure in App: tools-bar (fixed) | split-pane-area (flexible).
         // The split-pane-area will be managed by SplitPane, containing VT and Sidebar.
